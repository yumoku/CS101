# CS101
exercises and assignments of CS101 in Udacity by Professor Evans

Not really strictly follow  the same tasks as in the class, but may expand the scopes of those tasks. i.e. for ExtractLinks task, the code is used to extract all the urls from the input html file, and handled the corner cases that some html url includes new line signs. 

Thanks to Professor Evans and his TAs and guests for building such a great class!
